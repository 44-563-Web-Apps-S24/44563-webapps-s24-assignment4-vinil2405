    <h1> Vinil Kappa Chandrababu does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h6> Uncle Vanya Act 1: Anton Chekov</h6>

    
        <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="speech">a quiet, grey-haired, little old woman, is sitting at the table
    knitting a stocking.</p>
    
    <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech">is walking up and down near her.</p>
    
    <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="direction">[Pouring some tea into a glass]</p> <p class="speech">Take a little tea, my son.</p>
    
    <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6><p class="direction">[Takes the glass from her unwillingly]</p> <p class="speech">Somehow, I don't seem to
    want any.</p>
    
    <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="speech">Then will you have a little vodka instead?</p>
    
    <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech">No, I don't drink vodka every day, and besides, it is too hot
    now.</p><p class="direction">[A pause]</p> <P class="speech">Tell me, nurse, how long have we known each other?</p>
    
    <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="direction">[Thoughtfully]</p> <p class="speech">Let me see, how long is it? Lord--help me to
    remember. You first came here, into our parts--let me think--when was
    it? Sonia's mother was still alive--it was two winters before she died;
    that was eleven years ago--</p> <P class="direction">[thoughtfully]</P><p class="speech">perhaps more.</p>
    
    <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech">Have I changed much since then?</p>
    
    <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6> <p class="speech">Oh, yes. You were handsome and young then, and now you are an
    old man and not handsome any more. You drink, too.</p>
    
    <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech">Yes, ten years have made me another man. And why? Because I am
    overworked. Nurse, I am on my feet from dawn till dusk. I know no rest;
    at night I tremble under my blankets for fear of being dragged out to
    visit some one who is sick; I have toiled without repose or a day's
    freedom since I have known you; could I help growing old? And then,
    existence is tedious, anyway; it is a senseless, dirty business, this
    life, and goes heavily. Every one about here is silly, and after
    living with them for two or three years one grows silly oneself. It is
    inevitable.</p><p class="direction">[Twisting his moustache]</p><P class="speech">See what a long moustache I have
    grown. A foolish, long moustache. Yes, I am as silly as the rest, nurse,
    but not as stupid; no, I have not grown stupid. Thank God, my brain is
    not addled yet, though my feelings have grown numb. I ask nothing, I
    need nothing, I love no one, unless it is yourself alone.</P> <p class="direction">[He kisses her
    head]</p> <P class="speech"> I had a nurse just like you when I was a child.</p>
    
    <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA</h6><p class="speech">Don't you want a bite of something to eat?</p>
    
    <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech">No. During the third week of Lent I went to the epidemic at
    Malitskoi. It was eruptive typhoid. The peasants were all lying side by
    side in their huts, and the calves and pigs were running about the floor
    among the sick. Such dirt there was, and smoke! Unspeakable! I slaved
    among those people all day, not a crumb passed my lips, but when I got
    home there was still no rest for me; a switchman was carried in from the
    railroad; I laid him on the operating table and he went and died in
    my arms under chloroform, and then my feelings that should have been
    deadened awoke again, my conscience tortured me as if I had killed the
    man. I sat down and closed my eyes--like this--and thought: will our
    descendants two hundred years from now, for whom we are breaking the
    road, remember to give us a kind word? No, nurse, they will forget.</p>
    
    <h6 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h6><P class="speech">Man is forgetful, but God remembers.</p>
    
    <h6 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h6> <p class="speech">Thank you for that. You have spoken the truth.</p>
